                <title>Book Summary: Don’t Overthink It By Anne Bogel</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t Overthink It by Anne Bogel speaks about overthinking and how we can reduce that in our lives. I’m sure everyone know how it feels like being stuck in a loop of unproductive thoughts. Be it overthinking the right time to leave house or over analysing small decisions. 
Overthinking can take many forms — staying up late wondering something, creating negative scenarios in our mind, reviewing things that had happened in the past or second guessing ourselves. Such thoughts are often repetitive, unhealthy and unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study by Dr Susan Nolen Hoeksama from Yale showed that overthinking makes life harder, hurts our relationships and may contribute to mental disorders. 
Not only that, but overthinking carries a significant opportunity cost as our limited mental energy are spent on overthinking. No one really wants to spend their life overthinking, but the truth is, it’s hard not to. Unfortunately, women tend to suffer from more overthinking than men. A study by Amen Clinics done in 2017 showed that women tends more brain activity going on in the brain especially the prefrontal cortex, which in turn often leads to more emotional activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is valuable for those who want to focus on the things that matter and learn how to overcome decision fatigue. These small, cumulative shifts has helped Anne Bogel in her life and she hopes to share this information to help address these. The truth is that we can all do better, but it won’t happen instantly. It is a process which isn’t easy, but will be worth it. 
What I love about this book is that it provides some thought provoking questions for readers to think about and actions to act upon at the end of each chapter. Nevertheless, here’s a summary for those who may not find time to read the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-change-what-you-believe&quot;&gt;1. Change What You Believe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we may assume that we cannot help but overthink, it is a dangerous misconception. The way we see ourselves has enormous implications for how we live our lives. Stop describing yourself as a chronic over thinker, not even in your own head. Overthinking will no longer be part of our identity. Begin to describe yourself as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;someone who can make decisions confident&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;someone who is developing strategies to stop overthinking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the list goes on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting your mindset is powerful as &lt;strong&gt;once we know and believe we can stop, we begin to explore how&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-the-problem-with-perfectionism&quot;&gt;2. The Problem With Perfectionism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis paralysis is one of the most common cause of overthinking. Analysis paralysis is less about the underlying decision and more about how we go about analysing the decision. 
Examples include repeatedly postponing the decision making process, fearing we make the wrong decision, constantly seeking more options and reviewing information. 
This tends to affect those who are intellectually curious more, who seeks to understand and over gather information to a point where it overwhelms us. 
Another major cause of analysis paralysis is perfectionism. &lt;strong&gt;In trying to seek the perfect decision, we second guess our decisions repeatedly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tips to Reduce Analysis Paralysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do a reality check that are often a few good solutions rather than a perfect one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adopt a “try it and see what happens approach”: Choose a decision and see what happens, if something goes wrong, we can always iterate on it next time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Giving yourself permission to fail. Understanding that failure can be instructive and it’s okay even if we make the wrong decisions sometimes in our day to day lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-decide-what-matters-to-us&quot;&gt;3. Decide What Matters To Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our values drive our decisions. &lt;strong&gt;When we have a broader vision for our lives. many of the decisions we face become simple&lt;/strong&gt;. We can align our decisions, small or big, to our broader vision. In using a values driven decision making process, we can allocate resources efficiently to what matters to us most. Often, we need to “fact check” by reviewing if our values align with the way we are living our lives. However, it’s okay if you don’t have a complete clear big picture on your values. You can live your way into it, it’s part of the discovery process. When making decisions, we can see if it is a decision based on a specific underlying value we hold or one made out of fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-take-time-to-make-time&quot;&gt;4. Take Time To Make Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being a responsible adult, clearing your stuffs etc is actually the most underrated form of self care — Sarah Bessey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our habits can serve us, or not. We think overthinking happens in our head but it is in fact, much more systematic. We undermine certain habits until they fail us. For example, spending several hours trying to find something because we didn’t put them back in a certain place. Or when we forget to do certain tasks, doing them halfway and forgetting about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead, form habits that build us up&lt;/strong&gt;. Putting important documents in a location and putting things back where we took them. Finish the cycle where we take out a book and put it back. &lt;strong&gt;Leaving too many open cycles take up mental space&lt;/strong&gt;. Start building systems such as sorting the mail as soon as you bring them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overthinking does not just happen in our head but it’s also intimately connected to our physical spaces. By streamlining you space, you can streamline your thought and focus on what truly matters, rather than at other details. It also maintains a level of organisation that helps you find stuffs when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making time, our physical body matters too. Dr Emmons, the author of The Chemistry of Calm, states that sleep, exercise and diet can help us stay calm and be emotionally steady. In fact, a lack of exercise is tied directly to overthinking. In addition, we need &lt;strong&gt;to take mental breaks&lt;/strong&gt;. Often we undermine taking breaks because they are not productive. But thinking is hard work and when we are mentally tired, it’s easy to overthink. Give mental breaks throughout the day. 
&lt;strong&gt;Be wary of fake breaks where we mindlessly scroll emails or social media&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-speed-up-the-decision-making-process&quot;&gt;5. Speed up The Decision Making Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes making decisions can be difficult, with some requiring much more time. But at a certain point, waiting time become wasted time. We think taking time to decide will help but we may end up in an analysis paralysis. No matter the decision, beyond some point, we would be overthinking a decision. This can come when we are making a decision between two good choices or when we know what to do but is dragging your feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-pay-attention-to-what-you-focus-on&quot;&gt;6. Pay Attention to What You Focus On&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we pay attention to and think about directly affects our feelings. However, we get to choose what you think about! We need to be mindful of what we dwell upon excessively. If we think negatively, our brain reinforces certain thought ways. But what if no matter how hard we try, we still end up fixated on the bad stuff? We need active strategies to help interrupt overthinking and rumination the moment it happens. All these will help us to reinforce new and better thought processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategies-to-interrupt-overthinking&quot;&gt;Strategies To Interrupt Overthinking:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Begin to observe what you think about? What do you habitually focus on? Do your mind automatically look at the negative in things? What do you unhelpfully dwell upon?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look for the good: Instead of getting stuck in the negative thought cycle, disrupt it by looking for a positive interpretation. Alternatively, we can also consider a different viewpoint, rather than coming to a negative conclusion. In fact, begin a regular gratitude practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ignore/Invalidate unhelpful thoughts: Vast majority of us sometimes face intrusive thoughts that are unwanted and negative. However, not every thought represents your mood and character. We do not need to give weight and nurture to have thought in our mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schedule time to overthink: Therapist Amy Morin recommends this in order to prevent the thoughts from spilling over in the rest of the day. In fact, we can also write down our concerns as it helps to put things in perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get up and moving: It helps to physically distract the body. In fact, many studies have proven that exercise helps to give something to focus on, boost energy levels, reduce stress and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-streamline-decisions-made&quot;&gt;7. Streamline Decisions Made&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, we are required to make numerous decisions — what to eat, what to wear, how to tackle a conversation at work, whether to buy something on sale. Each small decision accumulates to require a huge amount of mental energy, where we eventually find ourselves in a decision fatigue. In order to overcome this, Anne Bogel suggest creating routines to streamline decisions. Having a routine is not confining. In fact, it frees us up to have mental capacity for more important decisions. Such predictability can help us clear away the mental clutter. Our routines can vary from eating the same thing every day or wearing a fixed outfit each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make room for when things go unexpected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even with all the planning, things may not go as expected. You may not rejoice when your plan gets disrupted, many overthinkers innately cling to old schedules. Consider building in margin for spontaneity in our routines and plans. This allows us to enjoy the unexpected surprises life brings us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-outsourcing-decisions&quot;&gt;8. Outsourcing Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we need to outsource the many decisions we need to make in a day, especially for those that we do not need or want to make. We can rely on our friends who maybe experts in that field as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-rituals-to-rely-on&quot;&gt;9. Rituals To Rely On&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A routine can be a ritual, allowing for us to take time to pause and be more grounded. This could be making coffee every morning or routinely going out for dinner on Friday. The difference between a routine and ritual is that we don’t pay attention to our day to day routine, but a rituals calls for us to be fully present in what we do — even if it’s drinking coffee. The specific action doesn’t matter, but its rhythm, regularity, and meaning do. We make each routine purposeful when done mindfully. The ritual also helps us slow our bodies and our minds. The right morning ritual encourages us to approach our day with intention. If we begin by purposefully drinking coffee, practicing gratitude, and journaling, we start the day feeling calm, centered, and ready to take on the day with the big picture in mind. Rituals help us stop overthinking over a long term by proactively directing our focus and stop overthinking in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-lets-splurge&quot;&gt;10. Let’s Splurge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be kinder to yourself. Splurge on the little purchases rather than overthink about whether to buy it. Accept that certain experiences maybe expensive but will bring more memories down the lane. Splurges are the unusual above average spend which will give us a special experience. On big splurges, consider “What is the money really buying me? What do I hope to get out of this experience? How do I measure the return on my investment?” Life is a series of experiences. Our splurges may not come cheap, but the memories are priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;book-review&quot;&gt;Book Review:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found this to be a fantastic and relatable read. I used to think of overthinking as something that was part and parcel of life and the way I am. Through this book, I realised that there are reason for some of my overthinking and active strategies I can do to overcome them. I believe this will be useful for many people who may be boggled down by the day to day overthinking. In reducing our overthinking, we can reclaim that mental energy and have the freedom to achieve the full potential in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A man is what he thinks about all day long. — Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the quote in the book by Ralph Waldo Emerson. We need to work and refocus our thoughts towards being the person we want to be. I would recommend for anyone interested to get the book and follow along the questions that can help kickstart the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Hustle Culture — Are You Part Of It?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently due to a health situation, I was forced to give myself some downtime and was unable to do any work. While I should be resting, the entire break turned out to be a VERY excruciating process. I spent the entire “break” thinking about what I would do if I could start work and how I was “wasting time”. As I browsed LinkedIn and Youtube, I saw how people were learning and starting new things while I was…well “wasting my time”. A friend of mine even started a Youtube channel and I thought to myself — “gosh I need to start mine soon!”. So many thoughts came to me, how I have to have to create content, how I should monetise my interests, how I have to learn data, how I have to master my personal finances. Then I realised, I fell into the trap of the Hustle Culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-what-is-the-hustle-culture&quot;&gt;So what is the Hustle Culture?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hustle Culture, as the name implies, glorifies the idea of constant hustling. It promotes the idea of toxic productivity where we obsess over radical self- improvement above all else. This means apart from grinding in our day job, we are often encouraged to learn or try new “side hustles” and create multiple income streams. And don’t get me wrong, I’m all for learning and trying new things. But Hustle Culture become toxic when we are expected to grind, to be productivity and to maintain positivity all the time. Every day, millennials and gen zs alike are exposed to hustle and grind content on social media. A quick search on youtube show what sells — content about productivity and side hustles. As a result, no matter how productive you are, you are often left with the feeling of not having done enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hustle2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A quick search on productivity videos on Youtube&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find myself to be the classic output of the Hustle Culture — feeling guilty for taking breaks, always feeling the need to be productive and self-improve. Even as I was supposed to be recovering, my mind wandered to how I can double down once I get back to the grind. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zj9r92p&quot;&gt;In a video by BBC&lt;/a&gt;, psychologist and blogger Dr Julie Smith shares what are some signs of toxic productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signs-of-toxic-productivity&quot;&gt;Signs of Toxic Productivity:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Working hard to extent it harms your health and relationships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Do you work long hours to the point where you do not take breaks, or take time to exercise? Do you neglect your friends and family at the extent of self improvement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Having unrealistic expectations of what you can accomplish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even after accomplishing things, do you find yourself disappointed thinking you could have done more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Restlessness and finding it difficult to rest even when it’s time to rest or sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When it is time to sleep, do you find it difficult to do so? Likewise when it’s time to take breaks, do you find your mind wandering back to work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I was and still am a big fan of self-improvement and learning new things. The issue occurs when it comes at the expense of our physical and mental health. How then can one tackle this balance between productivity and toxic productivity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tip I find really useful by Dr Julie Smith is to choose one thing to do each day, that you do just for pleasure. For me, that sometimes mean going for walks with my dog or playing a game I enjoy. Committing the time to relaxation and not to be “productive” really helps me to take proper breaks. This could be doodling for some people or cooking for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to remember is to be kind to yourself. A common subconscious train of thought is to tie productivity to our self worth. I fall trap to that too, thinking if I have a good career, run a side hustle and a side business that I would be successful and as a result, happier. That can only be further from the truth. Being productive is more often about the journey of learning more so than it being our value. We are multi-faceted beings defined more than our works! I love the comic below which sums up how life cannot be measured by just one yardstick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hustle3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Relatable Commic&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Relatable Comic by @lizandmollie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KkKuTCFvzI&quot;&gt;a TED talk by Robert Waldinger&lt;/a&gt;, shows the longest study done in history on what makes people healthier and happier. The results? Not fame or wealth, but relationships! (It’s a really good video that I recommend you watch) Amidst your hustling journey, do take time to remind yourself that you are worth more than your LinkedIn profile and remember to spend time with your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, don’t compare your journey with someone else. With social media, it’s so much easier nowadays for someone to see another person being successful and feel like you’re less. A good read is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjo7qGF2aPwAhUUcCsKHVZbD34QFjAAegQIAhAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2010%2F07%2Fhow-will-you-measure-your-life&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2pOdE44eZ0AcM6ZhEuP8YV&quot;&gt;How Will You Measure Your Life by Clayton Christensen&lt;/a&gt; in which he shares about how we have different yardsticks to measure our lives. The truth of the matter is, everyone is on a different journey based on their past, their passion and several other factors. I find myself often comparing to others who are out there creating non profits and making an impact on this world, while I’m only at the beginning trying to figure out what I can do. But I take comfort in the fact that I started today, and I’m learning slowly day by day. Likewise, you’re on a journey unique to yours. Enjoy that journey.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>TikTok for Small Medium Businesses in SEA</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;With the COVID-19 last year, it’s safe to say that it has transformed how many businesses conduct their business and reach out to their customers. For starters, fewer people are leaving their houses and spending less time shopping leisurely. At the same time, people are finding more unique ways to entertain themselves — be it the aggressive whipping of Dalgona coffee, or trying out new hobbies such as baking. One thing that took flight during the lockdown would definitely be TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last year alone, there was more than 1 million new downloads in Singapore. Many took the opportunity to learn and understand this new social networking site. Is this for the Gen Zs? Is it just a place for people to show off their dance skills? What’s the hype with TikTok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-potential-of-tiktok&quot;&gt;The Potential of TikTok&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself rather curious and soon jumped on board too. Thanks to the amazing algorithm that seems to always serve relevant content, I soon came to enjoy the amazing content and unique sense of humour on TikTok. 
Amidst my heavy usage of TikTok, I found 2 things that really surprised me. Firstly, the sheer reach on TikTok. Videos that appear on the FYP (For You Page) can easily get hundreds of thousands of likes. 
This content can be local content or content from other countries. Either way, the content tends to be targeted based off viewers’ interests. A clear example would be the popular video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insider.com/mi-pan-su-su-sum-tiktok-sound-llama-russian-cereal-2020-8&quot;&gt;Mi Pan&lt;/a&gt;, which showcases a llama dancing to a catchy tune. The last I checked, it had 100M views and has been trending on TikTok non-stop. 
Imagine if you could utilise TikTok to tap into such a large audience. Secondly, the ability to translate TikTok as a self-branding platform. Content creators on TikTok create amazing content be it acting, modelling or even sewing. One of my favourite examples to share would be fashion enthusiast Wisdom Kay (@wisdm8). 
Ever since posting his first video in January 2020, he has since garnered 3.8M followers, and was featured on Vogue and sponsored by brands such as Fendi and Balmain. This is just one of the many success cases of branding done right on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reasons-smbs-can-use-tiktok&quot;&gt;Reasons SMBs Can Use TikTok&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular hashtag that stood out to me was the #smallbusinesscheck which had more than 100M views. Small business owners would use this hashtag to showcase their small business operations and behind the scenes. This hashtag garnered a lot of traction, where some individual videos would receive &amp;gt;100k views and business owners would eventually share a follow up video on how their orders have exploded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me wonder in the times where people are staying at home, how can TikTok be utilised by businesses to reach out to customers (and perhaps face a similar explosion in orders)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many brands would easily go to Instagram and Facebook, it has become rather saturated and businesses would have to pay a significant amount in order to reach out to their target customers. A sizeable media budget may not always be available for startups and small businesses. TikTok could be utilised as a low cost platform to market to customers right to the feed. This thought stayed with me for a while and I soon began doing a deeper dive in the benefits of TikTok for small businesses. You can find the full research here but I will summarise my points below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;content-strategy-for-smbs&quot;&gt;Content Strategy for SMBs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than focusing on paid content, small businesses can focus on organic content instead. While there is no hard and fast rule to trending content, here are some content ideas which I observed from businesses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Posting Behind The Scenes Content&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tiktok1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Tapping into Relevant TikTok Trends&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tiktok2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Engaging Popular Influencers on TikTok&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tiktok3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example that followed such a strategy was Shopee PH who has garnered 79K followers with their organic content.
&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/tiktok4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For small businesses who are interested in marketing on TikTok but are heavily limited by their budget, they can consider to apply for TikTok’s Back to Business Program — an ad credit program aimed to help SMBs rebuild their brand. Despite TikTok’s ban in India and potentially in the US as well, growth in SEA markets remain strong and there is still a strong potential SMBs can tap into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can refer to a more in-depth analysis in the research deck &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tlNcb7dZ1kSv_H8qdNvzJj05kO2b5kVm/view&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or feel free to connect with me on Linkedin for further discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Top 10 Things To Do in Kranji, Singapore</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;As we enter into 2021 still in the midst of COVID-19 restrictions, Singaporeans have been actively seeking fun activities to do within this little island. Be it using the Singapore Rediscover vouchers or hiking on trails, people are trying out more new activities locally. 
Personally, I’ve been trying to actively take a break and decided to do a day trip to Kranji. Now you might be asking, what’s there at Kranji?
Kranji is home to over 100 farms, but only around 20 of them are open to the public. Aside from that, there also famous trails and historic sites in the area. While some of the information are found on the Kranji Countryside website, I hope to provide an itinerary of what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-sungei-buloh-wetland-reserves&quot;&gt;1. Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/kranji1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start off the day visiting Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserves, enjoying the different type of wildlife and plantation that you’ll not find in the city! Depending on which entrance you start from, you can enjoy trails with varying difficulty level. Do take a pit stop at the Kingfisher Pod and the Eagle Point to enjoy a paranomic view of Johor Bahru and enjoy the seabreeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-bollywood-veggies&quot;&gt;2. Bollywood Veggies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/kranji2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A must visit when I come to Kranji, Bollywood Veggies Poison Ivy Bistro serves up fresh local delicacies. The queue on the weekends can go up to an hour so do try and make a reservation beforehand! Otherwise, take a short walk in their farm where they harvest daily ingredients from. I strongly recommend the Nasi Lemak with the flavoursome blue pea rice and the dessert platter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-kranji-marshes&quot;&gt;3. Kranji Marshes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit neighbouring Kranji Marshes, which boasts a paranomic view on the Raptor Tower. Enjoy the greenery and wildlife along the way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit neighbouring Kranji Marshes, which boasts a paranomic view on the Raptor Tower. Enjoy the greenery and wildlife along the way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-hay-dairies&quot;&gt;4. Hay Dairies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/kranji4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, make a short pit stop to Hay Dairies, Singapore’s only goat farm. The farm houses a herd of about 700 goats, which you can get the chance to interact and feed. If you have not tried goat milk before, fear not as they sell fresh goat milk which you can try on the spot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-max-koi-farm&quot;&gt;5. Max Koi Farm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/kranji5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you may not be interested in getting any koi fishes, Max Koi Farm allows public viewing of their Koi fishes. There are koi fishes varying from the size of your palm to the size of your leg! Make a pit stop to view some koi fishes. Who knows, you may develop a strong interest in getting one after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-kim-yan-agrotech&quot;&gt;6. Kim Yan Agrotech&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kranji6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Picture taken from Singapore Food Agency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t judge the unassuming front, Kim Yan Agrotech is in fact Singapore’s largest mushroom and wheatgrass farm. If you have a group of 20, you can book a private tour to understand the mushroom growing process. Otherwise, you can make a pit stop just to buy some fresh mushrooms and wheatgrass drinks. (Do note that they do not produce wheatgrass drinks and mushrooms every day, drop a call to make your visit’s worth)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-nyee-phoe-gardenasia&quot;&gt;7. Nyee Phoe Gardenasia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kranji7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Picture from Gardenasia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entering Nyee Phoe Gardenasia, you feel as if you’re entering a little resort, with a bistro and a shop selling plants which you can bring back. Aside from that, you can also stay overnight here and enjoy a local farmstay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-crab-lovers-farm&quot;&gt;8. Crab Lovers Farm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kranji8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be fooled by the name, Crab Lovers Farm offers many types fresh seafood aside from crabs. Talk to any of the friendly staff, who will gladly explain how they farm their crabs and how to prepare fresh seafood. The kind staff kindly explained how to identify a male and female crab (tip: it’s got to do with shapes) and even prepared a sample for us. Needless to say, I left with a bag of seafood for dinner that very night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-kranji-beach-battle-site&quot;&gt;9. Kranji Beach Battle Site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kranji9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you leave Kranji, stop by the Kranji Beach Battle Site where you can understand the history behind Kranji and what happened here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-kranji-reservoir-park&quot;&gt;10. Kranji Reservoir Park&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kranji10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right opposite the Beach Battle Site, visit Kranji Reservoir Park which boasts an amazing view of Singapore. Enjoy the sea breeze and the sunset before you bid farewell to Kranji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kranji definitely offers a breath of respite from the daily grind and I would recommend for locals and tourists alike to pop by and explore a different side of Singapore. Take a visit and buy some fresh food!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Becoming a UI/UX Designer in a Tech Company</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview was done under anonymity at the request of the interviewer. 
However, if you would like to get in touch with Adam (not his real name) , please drop us a message and we would be glad to convey the message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having studied game design at a local polytechnic in Singapore and entering the workforce after military, Adam (not his real name) stumbled into the world of UI/UX. He is currently working as a UI/UX designer in a tech company. Here, he shares his story, and struggles in his journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi Adam, thank you for joining us today! Could you briefly share about yourself and what you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I’m currently a UI/UX designer in a tech company and have been here for slightly over a year. My day to day work consists of conducting user interviews, conceptualising product features, developing wireframes and ensuring the final product meets expectations. In my free time, I also do freelance works with a start-up that I am currently working with. I also started writing a bit more of my UI/UX experience on Medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I understand your background in polytechnic was in game design. Could you briefly share with us your experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Back in polytechnic, I studied Game Design and Development. To be honest, my experience was quite a rough one. For group projects, we often had to collaborate with programmers and artists. However, group projects often became difficult when my group mates did not pull their weight. I was also often bullied during school, which caused me to skip school to avoid facing them sometimes. As a result, I wasn’t very well liked by my lecturers who thought I was an irresponsible student.
In order to get more done on my own, I decided to learn programming. I resolved to be independent and to master programming before graduation. This is such that I could gain greater control over the work I did. In my course, we were introduced to Unity where I picked up Javascript. I eventually chose to pivot to C# as advised by game developers in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s interesting, how did you then stumble in the field of UX?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During my time in NS, I was still interested in learning how to code and design games. I remember expressing that interest to my superiors and those around me. Surprisingly, because of that, I was picked to code an application in the army on a ASEAN level. At that point, I remember I was extremely overwhelmed. While I had coded a lot on my own, this was my first time actually doing an actual full functioning application to be used by so many people. It was the most intensive 4 months of my life. However, I learned a lot from being thrown into the deep end. For example, I mastered a cross platform coding Xamarin which I now use in my work.
This project also made me realise that many of my Game Design skillsets was transferrable to UI/UX works. For example, in Game Design, it is important to understand how every element comes together — the sound, the graphics and the movements. This is similar to UI/UX where it boils down to how the elements contribute to the usability of the end product. I was also thankful that my prior learning of C# proved to be useful as it became the main coding language I worked with.
The application eventually was used to help people log information on repair works and army training. Seeing the end product help to solve an actual need was immensely satisfying personally. Overall, I was thankful that I got to upgrade my skills during my time in NS. I also managed to take away some connections, which eventually helped me to launch my UI/UX career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So after army, you decided to continue with UX?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Actually at that time, I was still deciding if I should further my degree in game design. I remember even going to a university open house where I met my ex-poly lecturer. At that time, I remember he said that I would never succeed in the gaming industry. It was honestly rather discouraging. After going to the open house, I realised the state of the local game industry was not what I wanted and I wanted to venture further to try UI/UX.
Meanwhile, one of the guys I worked with in army recruited me. He ran his own start-up providing end to end app development services and recruited me as a freelancer. I worked with them as a freelancer for a year. During this one year, I was severely underpaid, earning about $400 a month. During this time, it was difficult for me to pay for my own bills. I had to sacrifice going out with my friends at times to get work done or to save money. On top of that, it was mentally draining as I had to work long hours, often clocking in 4–5 hours of sleep on average. It was an extremely rough period for me, one where I did not see the end to and it made me feel rather hopeless. This also made me realise the importance of job security and getting a stable job. After my one year stint, I decided to apply for another job as a UI/UX designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you manage to become a UI/UX Designer without any prior job experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While I did not have any prior “working” experience, I had a lot of works to show. I had a strong portfolio from the series of freelancing work I did here and there. For example, I helped my church revamp their app, and did it from end-to-end. I also had a strong suite in execution, which I think helped. I have to admit that at the start of my interviews, I felt as if I were all over the place and didn’t know how to structure the work I did. However, I fine-tuned my interview skills over time and got better at it.
The journey for you definitely seemed tough and I would like to ask, what do you think was your lowest point?
It was when I was only earning $400, because my family was facing financial difficulties too. It was hard to support my family and I on such a low pay. However, I think all these low moments contributed to improving my hard skills and my determination to get things done. I’m currently earning above the industry average and I like to think that my hard works have paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any advice for anyone looking to enter the industry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing would be not to be used to being comfortable on the job. Being complacent and not upskilling put you at a great risk. I’ve seen people getting retrenched in their 40s and being unable to get a job after. It’s also important to hustle when you’re young. While you are likely to have less responsibilities, it’s the best time to learn, explore and try new things! Finally, to be open to every new opportunities. Sometimes, less appealing opportunities can open the doors to other opportunities.
Thank you for sharing all these. I believe it was super insightful for anyone looking to enter the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Book Summary: Too Good They Can’t Ignore You By Cal Newport</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The book begins with a simple question — Why do so many people end up loving what they do, while so many others fail at doing so?
Cal Newport brings up the argument that when it comes to creating work you love, following your passion is not particularly useful. In fact, for some, it could lead to chronic job shifts in search for this “passion” or “purpose”. Instead, he argues that the focus should be on building your “career capital”. He then introduces 4 rules to becoming, as Steve Martin quotes, “So Good They Can’t Ignore You”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-1-dont-follow-your-passion&quot;&gt;Rule #1: Don’t Follow Your Passion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport questions the hypothesis that the key to occupational happiness is to match it to a pre-existing passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs, for example, began his career selling computers to earn some quick cash. He was instead, more passionate about pursuing his spiritual journey. In fact, he even lost his job from spending an extended time at a commune. However, he stumbled into the world of computers as a big break. 
No doubt, he eventually grew passionate about what he did at Apple but this was not the case at the start. Perhaps, we should focus on a more pressing question. 
&lt;strong&gt;How do we find work that we will eventually enjoy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, many interviews done with leaders of their field promote the idea that it is hard to predict in advance what you’ll eventually grow to love. They all emphasized the idea that compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion. 
The astrobiologist Andrew Steele, for example, said that he had no idea what he wanted to do when he started his PhD Program and simply wanted options. In fact, the studies have shown that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career Passions Are Rare&lt;/strong&gt;: Less than 4% of students surveyed had passions relating to work or education&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion Takes Time&lt;/strong&gt;: The most passionate, happiest employees were those who had more years of experience and stayed long enough to become good at what they do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion is a Side Effect of Mastery&lt;/strong&gt;: Workplace motivation was largely related to autonomy and competence
In fact, “follow your passion” can be dangerous to follow. It convinces people that somewhere in the world, there’s a magic “right” job waiting for them, and that if they find it, they’ll immediately recognise that this is the work they were meant to do. 
The problem, of course, is when they fail to find this certainty, bad things follow, such as chronic job hopping and crippling self-doubt. 
While the phrase “follow your passion” sounds like innocent optimism, it could potentially be the foundation for a career riddled with confusion and angst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-2-be-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you&quot;&gt;Rule #2: Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport suggests to focus on the &lt;strong&gt;craftmen’s mindset rather than the passion mindset&lt;/strong&gt;. 
This means to focus on improving your skill set where you’re at rather than selectively choosing to do what you’re passionate about. 
Place a greater emphasis on what you can offer the world, rather than what the world can offer you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially so for entry-level workers, which by definition, are not going to be filled with challenging projects and autonomy. Entering such a job with a passion mindset will cause frustration at the bureaucracy or administrative tasks. The passion mindset also drives deep questions — “Who am I?” or “What do I truly love?” Such questions rarely reduce to a clear yes/no response. Cal Newport suggests that regardless of the type of work, readers put aside the question of whether the job is your true passion. Instead, focus on being too good they can’t ignore you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, great work are rare and valuable. In order to do such work, you’ll need rare and valuable skills in return. These skills are your &lt;strong&gt;career capital&lt;/strong&gt;. Holding on to a craftmen’s mindset will help build the career capital. Another example mentioned is a lady who left her job to pursue her passion of being a yoga practitioner. However, she did not have sufficient career capital, only obtaining a certification for a one month training program without much experience. She eventually had to close down her studio and rely on food stamps.
&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/book-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;What drives great work&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How then, does one become a craftsman? Scientists studied many grand master chess players to understand how. 
It turns out that the popular 10,000 hours rule played a big rule. 
The idea is that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of practice, which was found to be 10,000 hours. However, this alone was not enough, the hours spent had to be strategically to stretch the abilities of chess players and also provide immediate feedback. 
It is a lifetime accumulation of &lt;strong&gt;deliberate practice&lt;/strong&gt; that consistently explains excellent results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-3-turn-down-a-promotion-or-the-importance-of-control&quot;&gt;Rule #3: Turn Down a Promotion (or The importance of Control)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of gaining career capital, we can expect good work and greater control over what we do.
Control over the work we do can increase overall happiness and sense of fulfilment. However, with control comes control traps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Career Capital &amp;gt; Control:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is dangerous to pursue more control in your working life before you have career capital to offer in exchange. Control that’s acquired without career capital is not sustainable. This means travelling around the world running a travel blog may not be sustainable if you’ve not obtained career capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control Attracts Resistance
With enough career capital to acquire more control in your working life, your employee will also fight your efforts to gain more autonomy. This could be through providing a different role, a promotion or other means. Control will be bound to attract resistance. It is then important to gain leverage with your career capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fault of the courage culture to drop your work and pursue your dreams is not in the underlying message. 
Rather it is the severe underestimation of other factors, such as the career capital gained and the timing. 
The key is to know the right time to become courageous in your career decisions. 
To find out what this timing is, money can be used as an indicator. This is what is stated as the law of financial viability. 
When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control in your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. 
If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.
&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/book-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;When to leave&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-4-think-small-act-big&quot;&gt;Rule #4: Think Small, Act Big&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To construct work you love, you must first build career capital, then cash in this capital for the type of traits that define these compelling careers. 
&lt;strong&gt;Mission&lt;/strong&gt; is one of those traits that define a compelling career. Then, how do you make a mission or a purpose a reality in your working life? Many people lack an organizing focus to their careers because it is hard to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport compares finding a mission to that of a scientific breakthrough. We think of an innovation as striking in a eureka moment, where you all at once change the way people see the world, leaping far ahead of our current understanding. 
In reality, innovation is more systematic. We grind away to expand the cutting edge, opening up new problems in the adjacent possible to tackle repeatedly. Technology advances rarely break out of the adjacent possible. Likewise in our careers, you must first get to the cutting edge and forefront of our industry or expertise. Only then will our missions become visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A way to find our mission is to take &lt;strong&gt;small bets&lt;/strong&gt;! To accomplish this, take small steps that generate concrete feedback. Use the feedback to learn critical information on what to do next. If it does well, continue on. If it performs poorly, pivot to something else. This is in contrast to the beliefs of choosing a bold plan and making one big bet on success. For example, instead of taking a big bet to quit your job and become a Youtuber, you can start by taking small steps to make short Instagram videos and write on Medium as a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/book-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, pursuing your passion is not a flighty “drop everything and go” kind of adventure that we are used to hearing on the media. It is instead, a systematic approach and a lifelong journey towards finding good work we are passionate about. As a Gen Z who’s all about chasing my dreams, this book has personally changed my perspective towards work. I’d like to encourage millennials / Gen Zs who are entering the workforce and pondering on their purpose at work to read this book.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>I downloaded Tableau, Now What?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a Tableau ambassador, I often ask my friends if they use Tableau. I realised that while most people know the basic functions, they often hit a barrier when trying to develop their skills further. The biggest barrier being that they don’t know how or where to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been there before, I wanted to share some ways you can start practicing Tableau. A big issue I faced was that there was so much data that I didn’t know how to produce something of value. An easy way to start would be through #MakeoverMonday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introducing-makeovermonday&quot;&gt;Introducing #MakeoverMonday!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know, #MakeoverMonday was started by fellow data fanatics Eva Murray and Andy Kriebel. Every Monday, they release a data set and anyone can use this data to come up with a Viz (a Tableau “visualisation”). A lot of data fans would then interpret this data and come up with their own Viz.
I’ll break down how I did my first Viz in a few steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-checking-out-makeovermonday-data&quot;&gt;1. Checking Out #MakeoverMonday Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I browsed through the #MakeoverMonday data to see if I was interested in any of them. In my case, I chose the Berlin Airbnb one as I was quite interested in the data set. Of course, it is advisable to work on the latest dataset published so that you can receive feedback and learn from others doing it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tableau1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;MakeoverMonday Dataset available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/week-25-2019/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-looking-for-inspiration-from-various-sources&quot;&gt;2. Looking For Inspiration From Various Sources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at other Vizzes for inspiration which you can access on the #MakeoverMonday website as well. I checked out what others did for Airbnb in Berlin on Tableau Public, MakeoverMonday website and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tableau2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Some of the favourites of the week published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/week-25-2019/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-getting-inspiration-from-other-vizzes-on-how-to-analyse-the-data&quot;&gt;3. Getting Inspiration From Other Vizzes On How To Analyse The Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded some of the Vizzes I really liked to understand how others did it. I took inspiration from Meera’s Viz and tried to produce a similar Viz to find out how many Airbnb hosts there were each year. I looked at her file and tried to reverse engineer the process. I also added my own touch to it — in this case, I sought to find the number of Airbnb host which joined each year instead. (The links I took inspiration from are &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.tableau.com/profile/qknowz#!/vizhome/BerlinAirbnb/MMWK25?publish=yes&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.tableau.com/profile/meera6133#!/vizhome/MakeoverMondayWeek25AirbnbHosts/Hosts&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-uploading-it-onto-tableau-public&quot;&gt;4. Uploading It Onto Tableau Public&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few hours, I was done with my first Viz! It’s definitely not the best but it was a good first step! I uploaded my Viz onto my Tableau Public profile as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tableau3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Link to my Viz &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cheryl.tan4120/viz/AirbnbBerlinMMwk25/Hosts&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-sharing-it-with-the-datafam&quot;&gt;5. Sharing it with the #DataFam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also uploaded the link on Twitter, and of course, the data family was so encouraging!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who have not made your first Viz, I strongly encourage you to just dive into it. Of course, this is just my own way of discovering Tableau but feel free to do what works best for you!
It seems a bit daunting at first, but after doing your first Viz, you’ll realise it’s not that hard after all. Tableau is really easy to use and a good place to start visualising data. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out and I’d love to help!nually reintermediate integrated processes through technically sound intellectual capital. Holistically foster superior methodologies without market-driven best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>5 things I wished someone told me before I started my internship</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just completed an internship at ShopBack as a Regional CRM intern. For those who don’t know, ShopBack is a company that provides cashback for online shoppers. Interning at ShopBack was an amazing experience and I really learned a lot during my time there.
I ended my summer having learned so much more than what I expected. I hope that this article will be helpful for others interested in internship opportunities at ShopBack or any other fast growing startup in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-dont-expect-anyone-to-teach-you-anything&quot;&gt;1. Don’t expect anyone to teach you anything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you brush this off as common knowledge, you’d be surprised at how many of us may end up unconsciously expecting someone to guide us. 
As university undergraduates, we often have professors who are there to teach or answer our questions and consequently, most fresh graduates usually expect the same treatment when they join the workforce. 
However, once you start working, that won’t always be the case. Your bosses and colleagues may not always be there to teach you or answer your questions. After all, there is always a fire to put out (especially at a startup!) so don’t expect people to go out of the way to teach you things. 
That being said, Google is always your best friend! There are infinite resources out there that can help you. If you can’t find the right answer, find the right person who will have the answers and try to book their time. In this age of information, ignorance is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-own-the-change-you-seek&quot;&gt;2. Own the change you seek&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is straight up from the ShopBack’s core values. Although it sounds cliché, I soon realised the meaning of it. Being an intern, I was afraid to change the status quo. 
I would often have thoughts such as “I’ve only been here for a short while, I don’t know enough” or “My colleagues would’ve implemented it, if it made sense.” 
All these thoughts ended up as merely a barrier to suggesting and implementing new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I gradually discovered that a start-up is pretty much an open playground to try new ideas. 
There are always things that can be improved on and no idea is too small if it fixes an existing pain point. 
Even as an intern, you could bring in a fresh perspective and potentially help to improve an existing issue. 
If there is something you are looking to change in any company, rather than keeping quiet, why not take actions to change things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-youre-going-to-take-time-to-learn&quot;&gt;3. You’re going to take time to learn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re not going to learn everything about your job and the company in the first few days of work. It may feel daunting to not have it all together compared to your other colleagues who have been there much longer. 
Give it some time, learn on the go and you will eventually catch up. I think it is important to mention that you will make mistakes, big or small. It may hit you hard but take the learnings, move on and don’t make the same mistake again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I made my first mistake, I was pretty affected, thinking that I’ve screwed up big time and would be fired. That was when a fellow colleague reminded me that everyone makes mistakes and it is more important to learn from them. 
Moving forward, I came up with a checklist to ensure that I wouldn’t make the same mistake again — and it helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-meet-new-people&quot;&gt;4. Meet New People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot emphasise the importance of this. At ShopBack, we had a program where we were paired with someone random from the company every week. 
Initially, the thought of this scared me! When I first got paired with someone, I was so afraid it would be awkward. Looking back, it was pretty silly of me. 
I managed to learn so much from my colleagues and got to know many people in the company better. After a while, I started looking forward to meeting new people where I could learn more about them and what they did at ShopBack. 
In the short 3 months I was there, I got to meet people from the Operations/Engineering/Local teams and even met the CEO himself for breakfast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of my internship, I mustered the courage to ask people out for coffee/lunch to find out more about them. If you ask, most people will be willing to meet you even if it’s for a short 10 minutes. 
Of course, shout out to the people at ShopBack for being so kind and willing to meet me, even if they had a tight schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-be-willing-to-learn&quot;&gt;5. Be willing to learn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started my internship, I always reminded myself that I was like a sponge going in to absorb as much as possible in 14 weeks. Even after I had learned what was within my job scope, I kept reminding myself that there was still a lot to learn and kept an inquisitive mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work hard, people will recognise that and will be willing to share their knowledge with you. I was particularly interested to learn more about user testing although it was beyond my job scope. 
After casually mentioning it to one of my colleague about it, she was more than willing to share and teach me during her free time! I was even allowed to join in on some meetings for a project I was particularly interested in. 
I probably mentioned this a few times before but don’t be afraid to ask others to share what they know. You can learn so much just from asking a simple question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-summary&quot;&gt;In Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope these 5 points managed to shed some light on the experience of working at a startup. Personally, the experience at ShopBack was eye opening and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. 
The culture at ShopBack is truly one of a kind, with amazing people there who are very good at what they do. 
There is so much more to share about my experience at ShopBack and if you’re interested to find out more, feel free to reach out!&lt;/p&gt;
