### Hello there, I’m Cheryl 

Born and raised in Singapore, I currently work in a FANG company, specifically the Trust & Safety space to prevent bad things from happening on the internet. 
Driven by a strong passion to learn, I love trying new things and picking up new hobbies. 
Here’s some of the things I do outside of work:  
1. ✍🏻 On this website, I write articles relating to learning, mindfulness and life in general. 
2. 👩🏻‍💻 As a self taught coder, I enjoy learning about coding, data and technology in my free time. 
3. 💃🏼 I believe in living an active lifestyle and I do so by dancing and gymming. 
4. 🇹🇭 To connect with people around the world, I’m interested in learning new languages - I’m currently learning Thai at National University of Singapore. 
5. 🎹 It’s my childhood dream to learn the piano and I’ve recently fulfilled that by taking piano classes. 
6. 🪴 I take time to give back to the community too, I’m currently volunteering with Tech For She and Thrive Social Consulting. 

### Helping Others Grow 
Aside from learning, I love to share my learnings and to help others grow. 
I have previously taught data visualisation using Tableau in SMU Marketing Society and SMU business analytics class. 
I've also spoke at various events - specifically on CNA 93.8 Money Mind, Tableau's Data + Women and SMU Alumni event.
