Having studied game design at a local polytechnic in Singapore and entering the workforce after military, Adam (not his real name) stumbled into the world of UI/UX. He is currently working as a UI/UX designer in a tech company. Here, he shares his story, and struggles in his journey.

**Hi Adam, thank you for joining us today! Could you briefly share about yourself and what you do?**\
I’m currently a UI/UX designer in a tech company and have been here for slightly over a year. My day to day work consists of conducting user interviews, conceptualising product features, developing wireframes and ensuring the final product meets expectations. In my free time, I also do freelance works with a start-up that I am currently working with. I also started writing a bit more of my UI/UX experience on Medium.

**So I understand your background in polytechnic was in game design. Could you briefly share with us your experience?**\
Back in polytechnic, I studied Game Design and Development. To be honest, my experience was quite a rough one. For group projects, we often had to collaborate with programmers and artists. However, group projects often became difficult when my group mates did not pull their weight. I was also often bullied during school, which caused me to skip school to avoid facing them sometimes. As a result, I wasn’t very well liked by my lecturers who thought I was an irresponsible student.
In order to get more done on my own, I decided to learn programming. I resolved to be independent and to master programming before graduation. This is such that I could gain greater control over the work I did. In my course, we were introduced to Unity where I picked up Javascript. I eventually chose to pivot to C# as advised by game developers in the industry.

**That’s interesting, how did you then stumble in the field of UX?**\
During my time in NS, I was still interested in learning how to code and design games. I remember expressing that interest to my superiors and those around me. Surprisingly, because of that, I was picked to code an application in the army on a ASEAN level. At that point, I remember I was extremely overwhelmed. While I had coded a lot on my own, this was my first time actually doing an actual full functioning application to be used by so many people. It was the most intensive 4 months of my life. However, I learned a lot from being thrown into the deep end. For example, I mastered a cross platform coding Xamarin which I now use in my work.
This project also made me realise that many of my Game Design skillsets was transferrable to UI/UX works. For example, in Game Design, it is important to understand how every element comes together — the sound, the graphics and the movements. This is similar to UI/UX where it boils down to how the elements contribute to the usability of the end product. I was also thankful that my prior learning of C# proved to be useful as it became the main coding language I worked with.
The application eventually was used to help people log information on repair works and army training. Seeing the end product help to solve an actual need was immensely satisfying personally. Overall, I was thankful that I got to upgrade my skills during my time in NS. I also managed to take away some connections, which eventually helped me to launch my UI/UX career.

**So after army, you decided to continue with UX?**\
Actually at that time, I was still deciding if I should further my degree in game design. I remember even going to a university open house where I met my ex-poly lecturer. At that time, I remember he said that I would never succeed in the gaming industry. It was honestly rather discouraging. After going to the open house, I realised the state of the local game industry was not what I wanted and I wanted to venture further to try UI/UX.
Meanwhile, one of the guys I worked with in army recruited me. He ran his own start-up providing end to end app development services and recruited me as a freelancer. I worked with them as a freelancer for a year. During this one year, I was severely underpaid, earning about $400 a month. During this time, it was difficult for me to pay for my own bills. I had to sacrifice going out with my friends at times to get work done or to save money. On top of that, it was mentally draining as I had to work long hours, often clocking in 4–5 hours of sleep on average. It was an extremely rough period for me, one where I did not see the end to and it made me feel rather hopeless. This also made me realise the importance of job security and getting a stable job. After my one year stint, I decided to apply for another job as a UI/UX designer.

**How did you manage to become a UI/UX Designer without any prior job experience?**\
While I did not have any prior “working” experience, I had a lot of works to show. I had a strong portfolio from the series of freelancing work I did here and there. For example, I helped my church revamp their app, and did it from end-to-end. I also had a strong suite in execution, which I think helped. I have to admit that at the start of my interviews, I felt as if I were all over the place and didn’t know how to structure the work I did. However, I fine-tuned my interview skills over time and got better at it.
The journey for you definitely seemed tough and I would like to ask, what do you think was your lowest point?
It was when I was only earning $400, because my family was facing financial difficulties too. It was hard to support my family and I on such a low pay. However, I think all these low moments contributed to improving my hard skills and my determination to get things done. I’m currently earning above the industry average and I like to think that my hard works have paid off.

**Do you have any advice for anyone looking to enter the industry?**\
The first thing would be not to be used to being comfortable on the job. Being complacent and not upskilling put you at a great risk. I’ve seen people getting retrenched in their 40s and being unable to get a job after. It’s also important to hustle when you’re young. While you are likely to have less responsibilities, it’s the best time to learn, explore and try new things! Finally, to be open to every new opportunities. Sometimes, less appealing opportunities can open the doors to other opportunities.
Thank you for sharing all these. I believe it was super insightful for anyone looking to enter the industry.
