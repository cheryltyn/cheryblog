Recently due to a health situation, I was forced to give myself some downtime and was unable to do any work. While I should be resting, the entire break turned out to be a VERY excruciating process. I spent the entire “break” thinking about what I would do if I could start work and how I was “wasting time”. As I browsed LinkedIn and Youtube, I saw how people were learning and starting new things while I was…well “wasting my time”. A friend of mine even started a Youtube channel and I thought to myself — “gosh I need to start mine soon!”. So many thoughts came to me, how I have to have to create content, how I should monetise my interests, how I have to learn data, how I have to master my personal finances. Then I realised, I fell into the trap of the Hustle Culture.

### So what is the Hustle Culture?
Hustle Culture, as the name implies, glorifies the idea of constant hustling. It promotes the idea of toxic productivity where we obsess over radical self- improvement above all else. This means apart from grinding in our day job, we are often encouraged to learn or try new “side hustles” and create multiple income streams. And don’t get me wrong, I’m all for learning and trying new things. But Hustle Culture become toxic when we are expected to grind, to be productivity and to maintain positivity all the time. Every day, millennials and gen zs alike are exposed to hustle and grind content on social media. A quick search on youtube show what sells — content about productivity and side hustles. As a result, no matter how productive you are, you are often left with the feeling of not having done enough.

I find myself to be the classic output of the Hustle Culture — feeling guilty for taking breaks, always feeling the need to be productive and self-improve. Even as I was supposed to be recovering, my mind wandered to how I can double down once I get back to the grind. [In a video by BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zj9r92p), psychologist and blogger Dr Julie Smith shares what are some signs of toxic productivity.

### Signs of Toxic Productivity:
**1. Working hard to extent it harms your health and relationships**\
Do you work long hours to the point where you do not take breaks, or take time to exercise? Do you neglect your friends and family at the extent of self improvement?

**2. Having unrealistic expectations of what you can accomplish**\
Even after accomplishing things, do you find yourself disappointed thinking you could have done more?

**3. Restlessness and finding it difficult to rest even when it’s time to rest or sleep**\
When it is time to sleep, do you find it difficult to do so? Likewise when it’s time to take breaks, do you find your mind wandering back to work?

Don’t get me wrong, I was and still am a big fan of self-improvement and learning new things. The issue occurs when it comes at the expense of our physical and mental health. How then can one tackle this balance between productivity and toxic productivity?

One tip I find really useful by Dr Julie Smith is to choose one thing to do each day, that you do just for pleasure. For me, that sometimes mean going for walks with my dog or playing a game I enjoy. Committing the time to relaxation and not to be “productive” really helps me to take proper breaks. This could be doodling for some people or cooking for others.

Another important thing to remember is to be kind to yourself. A common subconscious train of thought is to tie productivity to our self worth. I fall trap to that too, thinking if I have a good career, run a side hustle and a side business that I would be successful and as a result, happier. That can only be further from the truth. Being productive is more often about the journey of learning more so than it being our value. We are multi-faceted beings defined more than our works! I love the comic below which sums up how life cannot be measured by just one yardstick.

In fact, [a TED talk by Robert Waldinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KkKuTCFvzI), shows the longest study done in history on what makes people healthier and happier. The results? Not fame or wealth, but relationships! (It’s a really good video that I recommend you watch) Amidst your hustling journey, do take time to remind yourself that you are worth more than your LinkedIn profile and remember to spend time with your loved ones.

Lastly, don’t compare your journey with someone else. With social media, it’s so much easier nowadays for someone to see another person being successful and feel like you’re less. A good read is [How Will You Measure Your Life by Clayton Christensen](https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjo7qGF2aPwAhUUcCsKHVZbD34QFjAAegQIAhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2010%2F07%2Fhow-will-you-measure-your-life&usg=AOvVaw2pOdE44eZ0AcM6ZhEuP8YV) in which he shares about how we have different yardsticks to measure our lives. The truth of the matter is, everyone is on a different journey based on their past, their passion and several other factors. I find myself often comparing to others who are out there creating non profits and making an impact on this world, while I’m only at the beginning trying to figure out what I can do. But I take comfort in the fact that I started today, and I’m learning slowly day by day. Likewise, you’re on a journey unique to yours. Enjoy that journey.
