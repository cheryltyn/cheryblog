With the COVID-19 last year, it’s safe to say that it has transformed how many businesses conduct their business and reach out to their customers. For starters, fewer people are leaving their houses and spending less time shopping leisurely. At the same time, people are finding more unique ways to entertain themselves — be it the aggressive whipping of Dalgona coffee, or trying out new hobbies such as baking. One thing that took flight during the lockdown would definitely be TikTok.

Just last year alone, there was more than 1 million new downloads in Singapore. Many took the opportunity to learn and understand this new social networking site. Is this for the Gen Zs? Is it just a place for people to show off their dance skills? What’s the hype with TikTok?

### The Potential of TikTok
I found myself rather curious and soon jumped on board too. Thanks to the amazing algorithm that seems to always serve relevant content, I soon came to enjoy the amazing content and unique sense of humour on TikTok. 
Amidst my heavy usage of TikTok, I found 2 things that really surprised me. Firstly, the sheer reach on TikTok. Videos that appear on the FYP (For You Page) can easily get hundreds of thousands of likes. 
This content can be local content or content from other countries. Either way, the content tends to be targeted based off viewers’ interests. A clear example would be the popular video, [Mi Pan](https://www.insider.com/mi-pan-su-su-sum-tiktok-sound-llama-russian-cereal-2020-8), which showcases a llama dancing to a catchy tune. The last I checked, it had 100M views and has been trending on TikTok non-stop. 
Imagine if you could utilise TikTok to tap into such a large audience. Secondly, the ability to translate TikTok as a self-branding platform. Content creators on TikTok create amazing content be it acting, modelling or even sewing. One of my favourite examples to share would be fashion enthusiast Wisdom Kay (@wisdm8). 
Ever since posting his first video in January 2020, he has since garnered 3.8M followers, and was featured on Vogue and sponsored by brands such as Fendi and Balmain. This is just one of the many success cases of branding done right on TikTok.

### Reasons SMBs Can Use TikTok
One particular hashtag that stood out to me was the #smallbusinesscheck which had more than 100M views. Small business owners would use this hashtag to showcase their small business operations and behind the scenes. This hashtag garnered a lot of traction, where some individual videos would receive >100k views and business owners would eventually share a follow up video on how their orders have exploded.

This made me wonder in the times where people are staying at home, how can TikTok be utilised by businesses to reach out to customers (and perhaps face a similar explosion in orders)?

While many brands would easily go to Instagram and Facebook, it has become rather saturated and businesses would have to pay a significant amount in order to reach out to their target customers. A sizeable media budget may not always be available for startups and small businesses. TikTok could be utilised as a low cost platform to market to customers right to the feed. This thought stayed with me for a while and I soon began doing a deeper dive in the benefits of TikTok for small businesses. You can find the full research here but I will summarise my points below.

### Content Strategy for SMBs
Rather than focusing on paid content, small businesses can focus on organic content instead. While there is no hard and fast rule to trending content, here are some content ideas which I observed from businesses:

**1. Posting Behind The Scenes Content**

**2. Tapping into Relevant TikTok Trends**

**3. Engaging Popular Influencers on TikTok**

A good example that followed such a strategy was Shopee PH who has garnered 79K followers with their organic content.

For small businesses who are interested in marketing on TikTok but are heavily limited by their budget, they can consider to apply for TikTok’s Back to Business Program — an ad credit program aimed to help SMBs rebuild their brand. Despite TikTok’s ban in India and potentially in the US as well, growth in SEA markets remain strong and there is still a strong potential SMBs can tap into.
