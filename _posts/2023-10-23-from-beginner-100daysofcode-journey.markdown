Back in December 2020, I was looking for ways to improve my technical skills and asked for advice on Twitter. 
That’s when Sarah from the Tableau #datafam shared that a few people within the Tableau community were trying out this #100daysofcode course on Udemy and suggested I gave it a shot.
At that point, I was still a beginner at python. I used it sometimes, but was nowhere near the point where I could code proficiently. 
In fact back in university, one of my professors in a coding module said to me “Do you even know what you’re doing?” 

Ouch. 

Either way, I was extremely sceptical if I could succeed in this challenge. But thanks to the persuasion of Sarah and fellow student Dzifa, I decided to dive right into it. 
With a lot of fear and doubts on whether I could finish the challenge, I officially started my #100daysofcode on January 1st.

### How Did I Start
I used Angela Yu’s [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy and it was an absolutely fantastic course. 
It was well structured with key learning outcomes each session. Each day starts with a short theory, followed by a few examples to try before ending off with a mini project.

During the first 30 days, I was extremely motivated and had a strong community who were doing it daily with me. 
Even though the course took 3-4 hours a day, I was coding every single day and only missed 1-2 days. However along the way, a lot of people began dropping off the challenge for various reasons and I suddenly found myself very alone in this journey. 
There was no longer a need to keep up with anyone doing the same challenge or to be accountable. This made it a lot harder for me to stick to coding daily as it was easy to just skip a day. 
Soon enough, I found myself doing it once every 2 days, then once a week. I knew I had to do something before I eventually stopped altogether. 
It was then that my mentor suggested that I posted it on LinkedIn as a form of accountability. 

### Tip #1: Share Your Journey
I thought my mentor was crazy initially, no one would care about my journey as a beginner. In fact, they’ll probably hate me for spamming their feed. Regardless, I decided to give it a try.

To my surprise, friends started asking about the challenge and people were keeping up with my posts. I was now accountable to my LinkedIn community. 
This kept me motivated to keep up with my coding journey and not give up halfway. On top of that, people I never knew started connecting to ask more about how I got started. 
A few of them eventually started their very own #100daysofcode journey. 
It was extremely heartwarming that my seemingly mundane posts were able to help encourage others, on top of helping me remain accountable.

### When Work Gets Busy
Past the 50 day mark, I started working full time and this made doing the challenge way harder. 
Instead of having the whole day to finish my daily coding project, I only had 1-2 hours to spare. 
On top of that, I was often mentally exhausted after a long day of work. 
But at the same time, I really wanted to finish this #100daysofcode and not give up halfway. 

### Tip #2: It’s all about getting started 
It was easy to just give up at this point since I can’t commit to finish an entire project a day. 
In fact, many people have the impression that they need to commit a good few hours a day to learn. 
The whole idea terrifies them to a point they don’t even start! However, as data YouTuber Ken Jee mentions in his #66daysofdata, it’s more important to get started. 
He encouraged his viewers that even if it’s for 15 minutes a day, they should try to learn one thing data related. Likewise with this #100daysofcode, I found that it’s more important to focus on starting each day than worrying about how long I spend learning. 
Rather than being fixated on finishing the project, I focused on learning for that 30 minutes - 1 hour I could afford each day. It may seem short but at least I got started. Don’t undermine such little progress. 
Instead, appreciate the fact that you managed to carve out however little time it is towards self-improvement.

At this point, some will raise a counter argument that they need more than 30 mins to truly learn a concept. 
While it’s great that people are trying to learn effectively, the fixation on getting every coding session perfect can limit us. 
Given that most working adults have limited time to learn, they shouldn’t be fixated on getting every coding session perfect. Perfect is often the enemy of good. 


### Charting My Own Course
Towards the last 30 days, I realised I didn't want to follow Angela Yu’s course. Don’t get me wrong, it was a really good course and covered a wide range of topics from data analysis, web development, web scraping, API, HTML/CSS etc. 
However, I wanted to focus more on data analytics and used DataCamp which offered great data science specific content. 
Unfortunately, it was at this point where my learning slowed significantly. This was largely attributed to the fact that I didn’t do any practical projects. DataCamp courses were mostly theoretical with spoon-fed answers

### Tip #3: Always Work On Projects
Through this, I realised that learning theoretical concepts and functions were not the most important part of learning python. 
While some theory is necessary, being able to approach a problem and conceptualise a solution is far more important. 
For example in Angela Yu’s course, there’s a given project each day where students are challenged to come up with a workable yet effective solution. 
Over here, I was trying to use Selenium to apply for jobs on LinkedIn automatically.

*What a fun challenge!*

**This is the most important tip** that have been emphasised by many others - Tina Huang, Ken Jee and even Angela Yu herself. 
Being able to approach a given problem and knowing how to debug your own code is paramount in learning how to code. 
Otherwise we’ll be like a well equipped chef that doesn’t know how to cook anything. 

Now you might think that you're way too inexperienced to do a whole project on your own. However, there are many projects with varying levels of difficulty. 
The Python Bootcamp course I’ve been doing has many projects for beginners. 
There are also various projects on Kaggle, or you can even follow along Youtubers who guide people step by step in doing projects.

Yes, it's going to feel scary and you'll spend a lot of time getting stuck, **but that's the best way to learn**. By slowly figuring out where you went wrong and debugging. 
The end result is going to be a lot more satisfying when you come up with a working code on your own. 
Personally, the best moments in this challenge was when I was able to successfully run a code after hours of debugging and trying different ways to solve the problem. 

### Finishing My #100daysofcode
Come September, I finally finished the #100daysofcode! It was quite a surreal experience, finally checking off all 100 days in my checklist. 
I had initially wanted to finish it by April, but as mentioned, done is better than perfect. At the end of the day, I'm super thankful I took on this #100daysofcode challenge. 
More than coding itself, this challenge taught me how to approach problems critically and the importance of perseverance. Despite some really hard days where I wanted to give up, I’m thankful I managed to push through before the end of 2021. 
This journey has developed me so much personally and I would really recommend that you try it out too. A huge shoutout to the people who encouraged me, for those who shared their experience, and for the new friends I’ve met along the way. 

For now, I’ll be taking a break, and spending some time writing on this website instead. 

Till the next time!
