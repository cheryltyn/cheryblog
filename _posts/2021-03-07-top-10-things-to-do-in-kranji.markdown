As we enter into 2021 still in the midst of COVID-19 restrictions, Singaporeans have been actively seeking fun activities to do within this little island. Be it using the Singapore Rediscover vouchers or hiking on trails, people are trying out more new activities locally. 
Personally, I’ve been trying to actively take a break and decided to do a day trip to Kranji. Now you might be asking, what’s there at Kranji?
Kranji is home to over 100 farms, but only around 20 of them are open to the public. Aside from that, there also famous trails and historic sites in the area. While some of the information are found on the Kranji Countryside website, I hope to provide an itinerary of what you can do.

### 1. Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserves

Start off the day visiting Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserves, enjoying the different type of wildlife and plantation that you’ll not find in the city! Depending on which entrance you start from, you can enjoy trails with varying difficulty level. Do take a pit stop at the Kingfisher Pod and the Eagle Point to enjoy a paranomic view of Johor Bahru and enjoy the seabreeze.

### 2. Bollywood Veggies

A must visit when I come to Kranji, Bollywood Veggies Poison Ivy Bistro serves up fresh local delicacies. The queue on the weekends can go up to an hour so do try and make a reservation beforehand! Otherwise, take a short walk in their farm where they harvest daily ingredients from. I strongly recommend the Nasi Lemak with the flavoursome blue pea rice and the dessert platter.

### 3. Kranji Marshes

Visit neighbouring Kranji Marshes, which boasts a paranomic view on the Raptor Tower. Enjoy the greenery and wildlife along the way!

### 4. Hay Dairies

Afterwards, make a short pit stop to Hay Dairies, Singapore’s only goat farm. The farm houses a herd of about 700 goats, which you can get the chance to interact and feed. If you have not tried goat milk before, fear not as they sell fresh goat milk which you can try on the spot!

### 5. Max Koi Farm

While you may not be interested in getting any koi fishes, Max Koi Farm allows public viewing of their Koi fishes. There are koi fishes varying from the size of your palm to the size of your leg! Make a pit stop to view some koi fishes. Who knows, you may develop a strong interest in getting one after all.

### 6. Kim Yan Agrotech

Don’t judge the unassuming front, Kim Yan Agrotech is in fact Singapore’s largest mushroom and wheatgrass farm. If you have a group of 20, you can book a private tour to understand the mushroom growing process. Otherwise, you can make a pit stop just to buy some fresh mushrooms and wheatgrass drinks. (Do note that they do not produce wheatgrass drinks and mushrooms every day, drop a call to make your visit’s worth)

### 7. Nyee Phoe Gardenasia

Entering Nyee Phoe Gardenasia, you feel as if you’re entering a little resort, with a bistro and a shop selling plants which you can bring back. Aside from that, you can also stay overnight here and enjoy a local farmstay.

### 8. Crab Lovers Farm

Don’t be fooled by the name, Crab Lovers Farm offers many types fresh seafood aside from crabs. Talk to any of the friendly staff, who will gladly explain how they farm their crabs and how to prepare fresh seafood. The kind staff kindly explained how to identify a male and female crab (tip: it’s got to do with shapes) and even prepared a sample for us. Needless to say, I left with a bag of seafood for dinner that very night.

### 9. Kranji Beach Battle Site

Before you leave Kranji, stop by the Kranji Beach Battle Site where you can understand the history behind Kranji and what happened here.

### 10. Kranji Reservoir Park

Right opposite the Beach Battle Site, visit Kranji Reservoir Park which boasts an amazing view of Singapore. Enjoy the sea breeze and the sunset before you bid farewell to Kranji.

Kranji definitely offers a breath of respite from the daily grind and I would recommend for locals and tourists alike to pop by and explore a different side of Singapore. Take a visit and buy some fresh food!
