For many of us, starting our career also means earning a consistent pay check and taking charge of our finances. As the old saying goes, with great powers come great responsibilities. With a monthly income, we are also tasked with managing our expenses and investments. For those new to all these, it can often get quite overwhelming. People often fall into two extreme ends of the spectrum - splurging without any control or scrimping unnecessarily. As such, I highly suggest that everyone should budget and track their expenses. 

### Why Budget? 
Most people I spoke to found budgeting cumbersome and stressful given that finances has to be reviewed on a monthly basis. However, I highly suggest that you should at least give it a try for 2-3 months and find a system that works for you. Once you get the hang of it, budgeting becomes a habit that helps you build a healthy relationship with money. 

When I first graduated, I knew I had to set up a proper system to budget and track my expenses or I might risk overspending. The worst feeling at the end of the month is looking at your bank balance and not knowing exactly where the money went to. I spent hours researching on apps and templates I could use to best track my expenses. That’s when I came across Zero Based Budgeting.

### Zero Based Budgeting
Zero Based Budgeting is a method that encourages you to allocate your monthly income to your expenses, savings and debts. The goal is that your income minus your expenditures equals zero by the end of the month. You can read more about it [here](https://mint.intuit.com/blog/budgeting/zero-based-budgeting/).

An analogy I’ve been given is that with Zero Based Budgeting, each dollar is like a soldier in your army. Every month, you give each soldier a specific task to do - to pay off your loans or your monthly expenses. This way, you know where every single dollar is going to each month. Zero Based Budgeting is not just about tracking your monthly expenses and trying to reduce it as much as possible. Instead, it’s about being mindful of where your money is going. Personally, Zero Based Budgeting has helped me create a healthy relationship with money. By planning what I’m going to spend on each month, I no longer feel guilty whenever I shop. The downside of ZBB is that it maybe difficult to budget each month especially when there might be unexpected expenses.

### How to Do Zero Based Budgeting

Some apps such as YNAB or Mint helps with Zero Based Budgeting. However, they were costly and I didn’t require some of the functionalities. After much research, I eventually decided to create my own excel sheet, which offered me the ability to track my money as well as monthly budget. Do feel free to download it [here](https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/k7a7m2) and tweak it according to your needs.

Aside from tracking your monthly budget, you’ll also need to track your day to day expenses. There are many apps which can help you with that, but I personally use this app called Moneyboard for 3 main reasons:
1. It’s a one off payment of $6-7, compared to many other apps with the same functionality but requires a monthly subscription.
2. It allows me to set my own categories and budgets. Making it easier to track my expenses per category. 
3. I can set the start and end date of each “month” to align it with when my salary comes in. This was one of my main factor when switching away from Seedly (another free app) 

I had initially tried to find an app that could sync with my bank but found that these apps often cost a lot. Considering the trade offs, I’ve learnt to instead be more consistent with my day to day tracking. 

Coming up with a system definitely took a while, but it definitely paid off once I started as it was very seamless. Nowadays, tracking my expenses becomes a lot more intuitive. I’m able to plan towards long term saving like a vacation or a big expense item. If you’ve not begun any budgeting, I’ll highly recommend you start today using my resources and tweaking it to your needs.
