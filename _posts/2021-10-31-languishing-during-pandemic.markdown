With the recent announcement of restrictions in Singapore extending due to the COVID-19 situation. There were mixed reactions though most seemed to reflect frustration and helplessness towards the situation. 
Personally, I couldn’t help but feel more (as Singaporeans would put it) sian about the situation. It feels like for the past year or so, my life has been somewhat stuck. I could neither meet people nor engage in new activities given the restrictions. 
Psychologists terms this blah feeling as languishing, which has been popularised by Adam Grant in his New York Times article released during the height of the pandemic. 
As he explains, languishing is a sense of stagnation and emptiness. It feels as if you’re muddling through your days, looking at your life through a foggy windshield. It is essentially the lack of both mental well-being and mental illnesses. 
This result in it often being overlooked, as there are no major disruption in our life and no episodic moments. Yet, people who are languishing aren’t exactly flourishing either. Instead, they fumble through life with an overall lack of interest in life. 
Needless to say, given how COVID-19 has affected everyone around the globe, this feeling of languishing has been on the rise.

Personally, [his article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html) and [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_how_to_stop_languishing_and_start_finding_flow) struck a chord with me. The feeling of being stuck, alongside being flooded by negative news daily has not helped overall. Given that there isn’t any certainty on when things will return to normal, it’s hard to expect any progression in life. 
Likewise, many online have expressed similar thoughts of having 2 years of their lives robbed away. 
In his TED talk, Adam Grant then offers a few suggestion towards alleviating this feelings of languishing.

### Mastery
The feeling of learning something and experiencing progress is proven to provide motivation and joy. This learning flow helps us move away from the stagnating feeling we encounter during the pandemic. 
The mastery does not have to be a big accomplishment but even small wins can contribute to the feeling of progress.

Whenever I feel like I’m stagnating, I try to do something that gives me the sense of progress. It can come in the form of reading a book or writing on the blog. 
In finishing a book, an article or even video games, I try to get into the learning flow in hopes of some form of progression. 
This has somewhat alleviated my concerns of letting life idly go by.

### Mindfulness
As most of us continue to work from home, the lines between our work and personal time becomes increasingly blurred. This means it’s easier to check out emails and work chats even after working hours - always remaining connected to work. While this may seem productive, it actually contributes to the feeling of stagnation. 
Uninterrupted blocks of time, may in contrast, allow us to find our flow.

During the pandemic, I’ve tried to be more intentional about being mindful. When engaging in writing or reading, I try to put my phone aside and focus on the task at hand. This has helped me focus better and become more mindful. Not to say I’m a master at it, but I’ve made much progress compared to the past when I was perpetually always distracted. 
In the past when I was working, I’m worrying about my other problems. Yet when I’m supposed to be resting, I’m thinking about work. If you find yourself in a similar state of mind, disconnecting with your work after working hours and focusing on what you’re doing may help you find your flow.

### Mattering
This is the most important factor that turns the flow experience into a peak experience. Knowing that what you’re doing in the present moment makes a difference. Making a difference to others can sound like a big term but this doesn’t just apply to our big life purpose. 
This purpose can simply be something intangible - such as spending time with our loved ones and having fun together.

For me, finding the purpose in what I do has been the most challenging. Often at times, I struggle to see the purpose in what I do, especially if it seems unproductive in the natural. Driven by toxic productivity, I tend to cast aside anything that doesn’t have a useful output. 
It’s hard to get rid of the mindset that non-productive things in the name of self care actually matters. However, in light of the pandemic, I’m learning to be okay with spending time spending time with my friends, or even gaming - as long as it matters to me.
