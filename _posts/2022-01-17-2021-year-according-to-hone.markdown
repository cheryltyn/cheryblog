Looking back in 2021, it was a year of uncertainty and growth for myself. I had just graduated from university and did not have a job lined up. On top of that, I was navigating failed relationships and religious deconstruction. All these were very uncomfortable, especially because I’m a huge fan of certainty and planning. However, 2021 also spelt the greatest year of growth for myself.
Here’s my 2021 as described by a song titled *smile more smile more smile more* by my favourite singer Honne (Yes, I’m a proud top 0.1% listener in 2021 according to Spotify).
The song start with the lyrics *this is one for the future generation*, and goes on to give advice on how our generation can live our life. Oddly enough, this song does remind myself of what’s truly important in life.
### 1. Learning New Things
> Create memories, not JPEGs, <br/>
Be creative, draw <br/>
Learn a language <br/> 
Dance, even if it feels really awkward <br/> 

Prior to 2021, I was never really interested in learning anything “non practical”. As a student, I often picked up skills that were “practical” and could either help me get a job or achieve other practical goals in life. However in 2021, I realised that I had a lifetime ahead of me to try and explore new things. I found more joy in trying new things, even if they may not provide any “useful” outputs. There were definitely some tough moments such as when I really struggled to finish my Thai homework. But I have to admit that it was an extremely fun year trying out new experiences! I also learned to be unafraid of failures, to enjoy the process more than the outcome. After all, that’s the whole point of learning. Here’s some rather random things I tried:
Learn Thai (khoop khun kha!)
Blogging (Figuring website, blogs, newsletters and so on)
Streaming! (Trying to stream myself playing games)
Skateboarding (Who knew balancing on a board could be so hard!)
Dancing (a new genre, which was oddly tough)
### 2. Supporting Communities
> Support your community <br/> 
Start With Your Neighbour and walk outward <br/> 

Prior to 2021, I would describe myself as rather apathetic to community initiatives. However, I started thinking more seriously about how I could give back to those around me more. I felt so lost as there seemed to be so many initiatives out there, and yet so limited time to find out about them. I did not know exactly what causes I was passionate for, and what I could actually do to help.
I decided to start small with opportunities around me. As I’m passionate about women’s related causes, I volunteered with Tech For She. I also volunteered with Thrive Consulting, an initiative aimed to help non profits with their business strategy. Given that I have limited time, I also tried donating to causes that I’m interested in, such as one to help support stray dogs.
To be frank, I still don’t know how to better contribute to causes I’m passionate for. Yet, I recognise that I’m taking slow baby steps to explore and discover how I can better serve my community. If you’re in a similar position and don’t know how to start, don’t be afraid to take baby steps in discovering!
### 3. More Self Love
> Feel the sun on your face <br/> 
Love your body <br/> 
Look into the mirror and think, “Wow! I’m amazing!” <br/> 

With the many job rejections faced through the year, it’s hard not to take it personally. I’ve always been rather critical of myself and even more so in 2021. I thought I wasn’t good enough, fit enough, talented enough and so on. But at some point, I realised that I would never be happy if I kept these self criticism going.
Instead, I tried to be more conscious to be more kind to myself and my body. As cliche as it sounds, we do need a bit of compassion for ourselves. An advice I’ve been told is to imagine if I were looking unto myself as a friend. How would I respond to myself? It’s so easy to forget but I guess that’s why self love requires a conscious effort.
Perhaps the biggest lesson of 2021 from talking to others on the same journey is that everyone is self discovering, growing and getting lost sometimes too.
#### Quoting Honne again
> Look, no one knows where they’re going <br/> 
You don’t have to follow a path or <br/> 
You don’t have to follow anything <br/> 
Just do what feels right <br/> 
But if I had to tell you just one thing to change <br/> 
Just smile more <br/> 

We may not have a clear plan for what’s next, but that’s perfectly fine. May we enter the near year by smiling more, no matter what 2022 holds.
