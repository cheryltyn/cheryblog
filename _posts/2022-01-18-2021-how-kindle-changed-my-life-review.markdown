Somewhere after my teen years to 2019, I never read a single book. I always heard of the benefits of reading and wanted to experience it myself. The wake up call for me was when the director of my team told me he read 40 books a year. I thought if such a busy man with a family could afford that time to read, surely I could as well.

Surprisingly, the biggest barrier for me were the physical books itself. They were costly and had to be lugged around everywhere. I also had very little storage space and had to think about my book purchases wisely. Deciding to take the resolution to read more seriously, I turned to the kindle instead. Safe to say, that was one of the best investment I ever made!

## The Benefits of a Kindle
Ever since I got the kindle, I started reading close to 20 books a year. While I'm not reading as much as my team's director, I'm learning a lot from the books I've read. I felt ever since picking up reading again, my eyes has been opened to the great work others are doing. I am able to have more conversations while networking or in my casual conversations with my friends. How I could go from 0 to 20 books boils down to the 3 points below:

### 1. It is easy to bring around
Considering the kindle is extremely lightweight, I can bring it out quite often. This makes it easy to read during small pockets of time - when I'm waiting for a friend or when I'm on public transport. Making use of such small pockets of time where I would have been scrolling on my phone otherwise has made it easier to pick up reading.

### 2. The ease of borrowing and storing books
I'm able to borrow books online at a lower cost compared to physically buying each book. This makes it easier for me to read a larger volume without worrying too much about the cost of it. Given that all the books are stored in my handy kindle with a rather large storage space, I no longer need to worry about where I can store my books at home.

### 3. The ease of going back and reviewing
Back when I was reading a physical book, I would never highlight or write on my books. But with the kindle, it's really easy to highlight and then review all highlighted content after. I'm able to go back and review some of the past quotes I've highlighted. Many people use Readwise to review past quotes, I personally don't use that but would recommend it if it's an important feature for you.

Of course, there are many who still prefer physical books - the flipping of pages, the joy of owning the book, the ability to pass it on. Yet for me, I found the benefits of the kindle far outweigh the benefits of physical books.

## Kickstart Your Reading Today
I had many friends who have never read in many years but were able to kickstart reading with a kindle. If you have a desire to read but feel physical books maybe cumbersome, I highly encourage you to pick up a kindle.
