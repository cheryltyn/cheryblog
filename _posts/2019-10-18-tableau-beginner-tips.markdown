Being a Tableau ambassador, I often ask my friends if they use Tableau. I realised that while most people know the basic functions, they often hit a barrier when trying to develop their skills further. The biggest barrier being that they don’t know how or where to start.

Having been there before, I wanted to share some ways you can start practicing Tableau. A big issue I faced was that there was so much data that I didn’t know how to produce something of value. An easy way to start would be through #MakeoverMonday!

### Introducing #MakeoverMonday! 

For those who don’t know, #MakeoverMonday was started by fellow data fanatics Eva Murray and Andy Kriebel. Every Monday, they release a data set and anyone can use this data to come up with a Viz (a Tableau “visualisation”). A lot of data fans would then interpret this data and come up with their own Viz.
I’ll break down how I did my first Viz in a few steps:
### 1. Checking Out #MakeoverMonday Data
I browsed through the #MakeoverMonday data to see if I was interested in any of them. In my case, I chose the Berlin Airbnb one as I was quite interested in the data set. Of course, it is advisable to work on the latest dataset published so that you can receive feedback and learn from others doing it at the same time.

### 2. Looking For Inspiration From Various Sources
I looked at other Vizzes for inspiration which you can access on the #MakeoverMonday website as well. I checked out what others did for Airbnb in Berlin on Tableau Public, MakeoverMonday website and Twitter.

### 3. Getting Inspiration From Other Vizzes On How To Analyse The Data
I downloaded some of the Vizzes I really liked to understand how others did it. I took inspiration from Meera’s Viz and tried to produce a similar Viz to find out how many Airbnb hosts there were each year. I looked at her file and tried to reverse engineer the process. I also added my own touch to it — in this case, I sought to find the number of Airbnb host which joined each year instead. (The links I took inspiration from are [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/qknowz#!/vizhome/BerlinAirbnb/MMWK25?publish=yes) and [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/meera6133#!/vizhome/MakeoverMondayWeek25AirbnbHosts/Hosts))
### 4. Uploading It Onto Tableau Public
After a few hours, I was done with my first Viz! It’s definitely not the best but it was a good first step! I uploaded my Viz onto my Tableau Public profile as seen below.

### 5. Sharing it with the #DataFam
I also uploaded the link on Twitter, and of course, the data family was so encouraging!


### Conclusion
For those who have not made your first Viz, I strongly encourage you to just dive into it. Of course, this is just my own way of discovering Tableau but feel free to do what works best for you!
It seems a bit daunting at first, but after doing your first Viz, you’ll realise it’s not that hard after all. Tableau is really easy to use and a good place to start visualising data. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out and I’d love to help!nually reintermediate integrated processes through technically sound intellectual capital. Holistically foster superior methodologies without market-driven best practices.
