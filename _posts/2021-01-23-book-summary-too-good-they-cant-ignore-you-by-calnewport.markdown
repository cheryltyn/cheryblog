The book begins with a simple question — Why do so many people end up loving what they do, while so many others fail at doing so?
Cal Newport brings up the argument that when it comes to creating work you love, following your passion is not particularly useful. In fact, for some, it could lead to chronic job shifts in search for this “passion” or “purpose”. Instead, he argues that the focus should be on building your “career capital”. He then introduces 4 rules to becoming, as Steve Martin quotes, “So Good They Can’t Ignore You”

### Rule #1: Don’t Follow Your Passion
Cal Newport questions the hypothesis that the key to occupational happiness is to match it to a pre-existing passion.

Steve Jobs, for example, began his career selling computers to earn some quick cash. He was instead, more passionate about pursuing his spiritual journey. In fact, he even lost his job from spending an extended time at a commune. However, he stumbled into the world of computers as a big break. 
No doubt, he eventually grew passionate about what he did at Apple but this was not the case at the start. Perhaps, we should focus on a more pressing question. 
**How do we find work that we will eventually enjoy?**

In fact, many interviews done with leaders of their field promote the idea that it is hard to predict in advance what you’ll eventually grow to love. They all emphasized the idea that compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion. 
The astrobiologist Andrew Steele, for example, said that he had no idea what he wanted to do when he started his PhD Program and simply wanted options. In fact, the studies have shown that
1. **Career Passions Are Rare**: Less than 4% of students surveyed had passions relating to work or education
2. **Passion Takes Time**: The most passionate, happiest employees were those who had more years of experience and stayed long enough to become good at what they do
3. **Passion is a Side Effect of Mastery**: Workplace motivation was largely related to autonomy and competence
In fact, “follow your passion” can be dangerous to follow. It convinces people that somewhere in the world, there’s a magic “right” job waiting for them, and that if they find it, they’ll immediately recognise that this is the work they were meant to do. 
The problem, of course, is when they fail to find this certainty, bad things follow, such as chronic job hopping and crippling self-doubt. 
While the phrase “follow your passion” sounds like innocent optimism, it could potentially be the foundation for a career riddled with confusion and angst.

### Rule #2: Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You
Cal Newport suggests to focus on the **craftmen’s mindset rather than the passion mindset**. 
This means to focus on improving your skill set where you’re at rather than selectively choosing to do what you’re passionate about. 
Place a greater emphasis on what you can offer the world, rather than what the world can offer you.

This is especially so for entry-level workers, which by definition, are not going to be filled with challenging projects and autonomy. Entering such a job with a passion mindset will cause frustration at the bureaucracy or administrative tasks. The passion mindset also drives deep questions — “Who am I?” or “What do I truly love?” Such questions rarely reduce to a clear yes/no response. Cal Newport suggests that regardless of the type of work, readers put aside the question of whether the job is your true passion. Instead, focus on being too good they can’t ignore you.

The truth is, great work are rare and valuable. In order to do such work, you’ll need rare and valuable skills in return. These skills are your **career capital**. Holding on to a craftmen’s mindset will help build the career capital. Another example mentioned is a lady who left her job to pursue her passion of being a yoga practitioner. However, she did not have sufficient career capital, only obtaining a certification for a one month training program without much experience. She eventually had to close down her studio and rely on food stamps.

How then, does one become a craftsman? Scientists studied many grand master chess players to understand how. 
It turns out that the popular 10,000 hours rule played a big rule. 
The idea is that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of practice, which was found to be 10,000 hours. However, this alone was not enough, the hours spent had to be strategically to stretch the abilities of chess players and also provide immediate feedback. 
It is a lifetime accumulation of **deliberate practice** that consistently explains excellent results.


### Rule #3: Turn Down a Promotion (or The importance of Control)
As a result of gaining career capital, we can expect good work and greater control over what we do.
Control over the work we do can increase overall happiness and sense of fulfilment. However, with control comes control traps:

1. Career Capital > Control:

It is dangerous to pursue more control in your working life before you have career capital to offer in exchange. Control that’s acquired without career capital is not sustainable. This means travelling around the world running a travel blog may not be sustainable if you’ve not obtained career capital.

2. Control Attracts Resistance
With enough career capital to acquire more control in your working life, your employee will also fight your efforts to gain more autonomy. This could be through providing a different role, a promotion or other means. Control will be bound to attract resistance. It is then important to gain leverage with your career capital.

The fault of the courage culture to drop your work and pursue your dreams is not in the underlying message. 
Rather it is the severe underestimation of other factors, such as the career capital gained and the timing. 
The key is to know the right time to become courageous in your career decisions. 
To find out what this timing is, money can be used as an indicator. This is what is stated as the law of financial viability. 
When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control in your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. 
If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.

### Rule #4: Think Small, Act Big
To construct work you love, you must first build career capital, then cash in this capital for the type of traits that define these compelling careers. 
**Mission** is one of those traits that define a compelling career. Then, how do you make a mission or a purpose a reality in your working life? Many people lack an organizing focus to their careers because it is hard to do so.

Cal Newport compares finding a mission to that of a scientific breakthrough. We think of an innovation as striking in a eureka moment, where you all at once change the way people see the world, leaping far ahead of our current understanding. 
In reality, innovation is more systematic. We grind away to expand the cutting edge, opening up new problems in the adjacent possible to tackle repeatedly. Technology advances rarely break out of the adjacent possible. Likewise in our careers, you must first get to the cutting edge and forefront of our industry or expertise. Only then will our missions become visible.

A way to find our mission is to take **small bets**! To accomplish this, take small steps that generate concrete feedback. Use the feedback to learn critical information on what to do next. If it does well, continue on. If it performs poorly, pivot to something else. This is in contrast to the beliefs of choosing a bold plan and making one big bet on success. For example, instead of taking a big bet to quit your job and become a Youtuber, you can start by taking small steps to make short Instagram videos and write on Medium as a start.

In summary, pursuing your passion is not a flighty “drop everything and go” kind of adventure that we are used to hearing on the media. It is instead, a systematic approach and a lifelong journey towards finding good work we are passionate about. As a Gen Z who’s all about chasing my dreams, this book has personally changed my perspective towards work. I’d like to encourage millennials / Gen Zs who are entering the workforce and pondering on their purpose at work to read this book.
