I started reading this book hoping to get more perspective on how to deal with conversations at work. Instead, what I got were insights and strategies on how to deal with EVERY crucial conversations in life. The book provides good strategies on how to approach a conversation when stakes are high, and how to bring your point across effectively and cautiously. I also love how it is backed up by research as the team that wrote this book interviewed 20,000 people over 25 years to understand what makes an individual successful in their organisation. Given the depth of the book, I will only focus on the first few chapters on building mutual purpose and avoiding the Fool's Choice.

Before that, let us define what a crucial conversation is. It is simply put, any conversation where opinions vary, stakes are high and emotions run strong count for a crucial conversation. This means a conversation with your boss regarding a promotion, or an argument with your spouse. We often handle crucial conversations poorly for many reasons. 

1. We're under pressure and emotions are running high. 
2. Even with tons of practice beforehand, conversations may still turn awry when we get an unexpected reply. 

This results in unhealthy downward spirals that can see relationships ending. In comparison, research has shown that engaging well in crucial conversation will help our relationships, career and even health.

### The Root Of Effective Conversations   
The most influential individuals in an organisation are ones who can get things done and at the same time, build relationships. The good news is we don't need to choose between being honest and effective at work. Take Kevin for example, one of the eight VP who was identified by many in his company to be exceedingly influential. While the CEO of the company was pitching a terrible idea, he was the only one who bravely engaged in a crucial conversation in a respectful manner. This is unlike many of his colleagues who kept quiet for fear of facing the wrath of their CEO. 
Here is the key mistake that many of us makes in our conversations — We believe that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend. We believe in **the Fool's Choice, where we are stuck between two terrible options**. An example of this is thinking something along the line of “I can either suffer, or flare up at the person who seems to be the root cause of all my problems.” However, individuals like Kevin are able to see beyond that. Instead, he ask an overarching question: 
> How can I be 100% honest and yet at the same time, be 100% respectful? 

When it comes to risky and emotional conversations, skilled people find a way to get all relevant information out in the open. They do so by filling the *Pool of Shared Meaning*. When engaging in crucial conversation, we usually don't share the same pool. People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool, even if they don't agree with it. As the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in two ways. They are exposed to more accurate information and makes better choice. As a result of the free flow of meaning, the whole becomes better than the sum of the parts. Not only that, but since meaning is shared, people willingly act on whatever decisions they make - with unity and conviction. The time you spent initially building the shared pool of meaning pays off with a faster, more unified and committed action later on. With that, let's dive into the steps to engage in crucial conversations.

### 1.	Start with the Heart
The first step towards achieving results you want is to fix the perception that others are the source of all your problems. This will limit the dialogue and progress that we can have with them. We should instead, be more introspective on how we can work on driving more meaningful conversations. In crucial conversations, we should start with the heart, specifically our own. This means starting discussions with the right motives and staying focused on our end goal no matter what happens. At this point, many people fall trap into the Fool’s Choice. The Fool’s Choice is believing that there are only two extreme either/or outcomes from a conversation. Unlike others who justify their unhealthy behaviour with the Fool's Choice, we can believe that healthy dialogue is always an option despite the circumstances. Diving deeper, we can ask ourselves these questions when we find ourselves slipping out of dialogues:

•	What do I really want for myself, others and this relationship?

•	How would I behave if I really wanted these results?

Avoiding the Fool's Choice can be difficult. After all, we adore the ease of simply choosing between attacking or hiding. But by refusing the Fool's Choice, we’re able to open ourselves up to new choices. Rather than an either/or choice, it becomes a search for other alternatives. 
A practical pointer would be to consider what we want as an end goal, along with what we don't want. We can then present our brain with a more complex question by combining what we want and don't want into a question.

### 2. Learn to Look
We need to learn to identify when a conversation turns from a simple discussion to a crucial one. Signs of a crucial conversation include physical signals such as a faster heartbeat or a tightening in our stomach. Other behavioural signs include raising or voices and finger pointing. 
When caught in a crucial conversations riled with emotions, most of us are too fixated on the content that we forget the external conditions of the conversation. This makes it difficult for us to pull ourselves out of the argument in order to see what's happening. By identifying when a conversation gets crucial, we can then focus on ensuring safety of the conversation. Safety is extremely important as it allows comfortable sharing into the shared pool of meaning. As people begin to feel unsafe in a conversation, they often move to silence or violence.

Silence - Withholding from the shared pool of meaning and is often dealt with the three following methods:
1.	Avoidance: Steering completely away from sensitive issues
2.	Masking: Selectively or understating our true opinions using tactics such as sarcasm, sugarcoating and couching.
3.	Withdrawing: Pulling out of a conversation altogether. It's often used as the person may feel that they cannot talk about it without arguing.

Violence - Trying to force meaning into the shared pool of meaning and is often dealt with the three following methods:
1. Controlling: Forcing your views on others or dominating the conversation by eg. cutting others off, overstating your facts, speaking in absolutes or using directive questions.
2. Labelling: Putting a label on people or ideas to dismiss them with a stereotype. Eg. “You’re acting like a girl”
3. Attacking: Moving from trying to resolve the problem to making the person suffer through belittling and threatening.
This means people become defensive in crucial conversations because they no longer feel safe in a conversation, not because of what you say. 
Rather than being defensive over their reactions, we can view them as signs that people feel unsafe. It's also important for us to look for our own styles when safety has been violated during a crucial conversation. That way, we are able to understand our response and alter our strategy if necessary.

### 3. Make it Safe 
When others move to silence or violence, step out of the conversation in an attempt to build safety. To establish safety, the first step would be to identify which of the following two conditions of safety is at risk.

**1. Mutual Purpose**: Do others believe you care about their goals in the conversation? Mutual Purpose means that others perceive you’re working towards a common outcome in the conversation. A sign that mutual purpose is at risk is when debates occur.
To resolve the lack of mutual purpose, we can try to look for mutuality. Find a mutual purpose that would be so motivating to the other party.

**2. Mutual Respect**: Do others believe you respect them? Without mutual respect, the conversation tends to tank as people will be fixated on the lack of respect.

Start by looking for telltale signs - when people are charged with emotions and display signs of anger. It maybe difficult to maintain mutual respect especially when we are not given the due respect. In such a scenario, we can counteract the feelings by looking for ways we are similar - to empathise and sympathise with them.

If respect has been violated, it would be best to **apologise**. Apologising maybe difficult, but by sacrificing our ego, we are rewarded with healthy dialogue and healthier results. However, if the mutual purpose has been misunderstood, we can work on emphasising the mutual purpose using **Contrasting**. Contrasting means clearly stating what we don't intend, and what we intend for instead. Contrasting is not apologising, but a way to ensure the message gets across clearly. It allows added context and proportion to be provided to the situation at hand. 
If it seems that there's no mutual purpose, we need to commit to **seek a mutual purpose**. This can be tough as we have to put down our belief that our perspective is the best. This is done by moving to a more encompassing, big picture goal. Only after a mutual purpose is built can we brainstorm a resolution. In coming up with new strategies, it’s important to suspend judgement and consciously be open to new solutions. 
**It’s important to remember that only when safety is restored, can we go back to the issue at hand and continue the dialogue.**

Overall, when entering a crucial conversation, one has to keep in mind building a shared pool of meaning and safety of the conversation. Only then can we have healthy conversations and relationships moving forward. 

What I’ve written is only a snippet of the learnings in the book. The book also gave a lot of practical and real examples such as navigating tough conversations at work, or a disagreement with our loved ones. Personally as I read this book, I was skeptical about the practicality of the book. I thought to myself "Well, this doesn't apply to my case, mine is special and such a strategy won't work." However, the book called out how many people felt the same way too but how the strategies can apply even in seemingly impossible scenarios. Learning how to navigate crucial conversations is a lifelong learning journey but I’m sure if we begin today, we will only get better.
